    <h2>About this website</h2>

    <p><strong>www.jover.be</strong>: I own this URL since the beginning of my experiments on the web.</p>
    <p>The first acceptable version of this website was a portfolio, which I created right after I graduated in Software Development in 2010.</p>
    <p>The mail goal back then for it was to support my curriculum vitae when applying for a job.</p>
    <p>Since then I'm working at <a href="http://www.amplexor.com/">AMPLEXOR</a>, originally a company which is specialized in Document & Enterprise Content Management, but currently has a broader spectrum of services.</p>
    <p>After that, the website went idle for some time, but today it is an outlet for development-related experiences.</p>
    <p>This site is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator</li>
      <li>Hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
    </ul>
