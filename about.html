    <p>Born in '88, living near Leuven - Belgium.</p>

    <h2>About this website</h2>

    <p><strong>www.jover.be</strong>: I own this URL since the beginning of my experiments on the web.</p>
    <p>The first acceptable version of this website was a portfolio, created in 2010, right after I graduated in Software Development.</p>
    <p>The main goal back then was to support my curriculum vitae when applying for a job.</p>
    <p>Today it is an outlet for development-related experiences.</p>
    <p>This site is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator</li>
      <li>Hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
    </ul>
